I Don't Give A Fuck Public License

This license is intended to who does not want to care about the license nor whatever the other may do with your software. This license is also a disclaimer but written by the magical word of English: 'fuck'.

This may contain strong word, some may consider funny, some may not. If you cannot use this license

I will fork this project and called IDCPL (I Don't Care Public License)

0. I don't give a fuck.
1. You agree that you don't give a fuck.
2. You agree that your use of this will have nothing to fuck with me now and in the future.
3. You don't fuck me legally/illegally.

As long as you agree with these term, you are free to do fucking anything, whether legal or not legal in your country, because I don't give a fuck. If you don't agree with my term, fuck off.

I don't give a fuck about you as long as:

0. I don't give a fuck.
1. You don't give a fuck
2. Both of us will give no fuck about each other.
3. If I do something with this, you agree that you will give no fuck about it.

That's all, now do what the fuck you want.

## Some explanation
None. Although this may sound like a public domain license, it is not like that.

### For Original Creator/Developer
You acknowledge you will have ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY for ANYTHING happen with the user. You acknowledge that other may change the author name, citing their own name and do what the fuck they want, AND THIS IS ALLOWED AS LONG AS YOU USE THIS LICENSE, even though this is your work.

Pro: You can do what the fuck you want.

Con: They (users) can do what the fuck they want, as long as both parties agree to not give a fuck about each other.

### For User (meaning 'a man who use the work from original creator, developer')
This license allow you to do what they want with these stuffs, including copying, reproducing and claiming that this is you work without his consent, even using it commercially is allowed. There is no plagiarism as long as the work is licensed under this IDGAFPL.

However, as long as the you agree that you won't do ANYTHING the original developer, this is fine in any case. For example, if you sue the creator because he releases a forked project of his work and it damages you, either financially or non-financially, you simply violate the license.

Pro: You can do what the fuck you want, if you want to claim that you create this, it is also fine. No plagiarism

Con: If he do something with his project and it damage you financially or non-financially, you will have to leave him alone.

### Violation
Both parties will have to agree that they will give no fuck about each other. In case one party want to give a fuck, fuck them and tell them to get the fuck out.

## Usage
Why would you ask this? I don't give a fuck. Do what the fuck you want.

## What is this?
This part is a part of a part of a part of a part of the stupidest thing I have ever made. This may make your life easier by telling the other to fuck off.
