This license is also a disclaimer but written by the magical word of English: 'fuck'.\r\n\r\nThis may contain strong word, some may consider funny, some may not.

I don't give a fuck.\r\n1. You don't give a fuck\r\n2. Both of us will give no fuck about each other.\r\n3. If I do something with this, you agree that you will give no fuck about it.\r\n\r\nThat's all, now do what the fuck you want.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Some explanation\r\nNone. Although this may sound like a public domain license, it is not like that.\r\n\r\n### For Original Creator/Developer\r\nYou acknowledge you will have ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY for ANYTHING happen with the user. You acknowledge that other may change the author name, citing their own name and do what the fuck they want, AND THIS IS ALLOWED AS LONG AS YOU USE THIS LICENSE, even though this is your work.\r\n\r\nPro: You can do what the fuck you want.\r\n\r\nCon: They (users) can do what the fuck they want, as long as both parties agree to not give a fuck about each other.\r\n\r\n### For User (meaning 'a man who use the work from original creator, developer')\r\nThis license allow you to do what they want with these stuffs, including copying, reproducing and claiming that this is you work without his consent, even using it commercially is allowed. There is no plagiarism as long as the work is licensed under this IDGAFPL.\r\n\r\nHowever, as long as the you agree that you won't do ANYTHING the original developer, this is fine in any case. For example, if you sue the creator because he release a forked project of his work and it damage you, either financially or non-financially, you simply violate the license.\r\n\r\nPro: You can do what the fuck you want, if you want to claim that you create this, it is also fine. No plagiarism\r\n\r\nCon: If he do something with his project and it damage you financially or non-financially, you will have to leave him alone.\r\n\r\n### Violation\r\nBoth parties will have to agree that they will give no fuck about each other. In case one party want to give a fuck, fuck them and tell them to get the fuck out.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nWhy would you ask this? I don't give a fuck. Do what the fuck you want.\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\nThis part is a part of a part of a part of a part of the stupidest thing I have ever made. This may make your life easier by telling the other to fuck off.\r\n\r\n##FAQ (fucking answered question)\r\n- Where is \"we\"?\r\n  - I don't give a fuck about that.\r\n- How can the license protect me?\r\n  - As long as the user don't fuck you, and as long as they don't give a fuck.\r\n- Help me, they are fucking around with my project/software/what-the-fuck-that-is.\r\n  - Simply tell them to fuck off. If you can't, I don't give a fuck.\r\n- Can I do something illegally with this license?\r\n  - I don't give a fuck. You can license your software how the fuck you want.\r\n  - However, the user can claim that this was his software and fuck you legally. In that case, tell the user to fuck off.\r\n    - First thing, if this software is create by you, you are free to use this license. By claiming that this is his software, he simply agree that he will not give a fuck about you.\r\n    - Second, when you steal/pirate/copy the software/source code from another big company and claim that this is your software, this also create a loophole in the license itself. I am sure that company will fuck you legally for stealing source code/binary/idea/what-the-fuck-that-is. In that case, please do what the fuck you want to protect yourself. Simply using this license does not mean they won't fuck you.\r\n    - Finally, this license is not valid in the court of law nor anywhere else.
