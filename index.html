<ul>
<li>Where is "we"?

<ul>
<li>I don't give a fuck about that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can the license protect me?

<ul>
<li>As long as the user don't fuck you, and as long as they don't give a fuck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help me, they are fucking around with my project/software/what-the-fuck-that-is.

<ul>
<li>Simply tell them to fuck off. If you can't, I don't give a fuck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can I do something illegally with this license?

<ul>
<li>I don't give a fuck. You can license your software how the fuck you want.</li>
<li>However, the user can claim that this was his software and fuck you legally. In that case, tell the user to fuck off.

<ul>
<li>First thing, if this software is create by you, you are free to use this license. By claiming that this is his software, he simply agree that he will not give a fuck about you.</li>
<li>Second, when you steal/pirate/copy the software/source code from another big company and claim that this is your software, this also create a loophole in the license itself. I am sure that company will fuck you legally for stealing source code/binary/idea/what-the-fuck-that-is. In that case, please do what the fuck you want to protect yourself. Simply using this license does not mean they won't fuck you.</li>
<li>Finally, this license is not valid in the court of law nor anywhere else. Just because I write this doesn't mean this license is valid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can I use this license to protect myself from those big guys?

<li>Obviously, you can't.</li>
<li>If they don't give a fuck about that, you are fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can I take ownership of this license?

<ul>
<li>As long as you follow what the fuck is written up there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
